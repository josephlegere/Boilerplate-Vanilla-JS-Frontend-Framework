/* delete appinstantiate, replace with just router
/* need to have some sort entry point, this would act as an Instantiate
/* route.js and page should join, or some sort of combination of the two => route.js is now page.js
add a feature in router where a router could nested or some sort of groupings
add an authen in the app

for the routes, instead of just Instance of Pages, use the Instance of the dedicated Page e.g. 'class Home', 'class about'

/* App.js is the only main entry point, create its own class that is a modified version of page,
    - in App class, this is where you would enable the Router class
